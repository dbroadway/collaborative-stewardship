# Collaborative Stewardship Simulation

## Overview

This project simulates a Collaborative Stewardship society, modeling the interactions between multiple "Resilience Hubs" in a post-capitalist, environmentally-conscious world. The simulation explores how communities might balance resource management, population growth, environmental health, and social factors in a sustainable system.

## Key Components

1. Resilience Hubs: Self-contained communities that manage resources, population, and sustainability practices.
2. Collaborative Stewardship: An overarching system that manages interactions between hubs and global resources.

## Metrics Simulated

- Total Resources
- Population
- Happiness
- Environmental Health
- Social Cohesion
- Sustainability Practices

## Key Features

- Dynamic resource production and consumption
- Inter-hub resource sharing and knowledge transfer
- Environmental impact modeling
- Population dynamics responsive to resource availability and quality of life
- Random events affecting hub development
- Long-term sustainability planning

## File Structure

- `resilience_hub.py`: Defines the ResilienceHub class
- `collaborative_stewardship.py`: Defines the CollaborativeStewardship class
- `simulation_runner.py`: Main script to run the simulation and visualize results

## How to Run the Simulation

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the required libraries (numpy, matplotlib, scipy).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Run the simulation using:
```
python simulation_runner.py
```
5. When prompted, enter the total initial population for the simulation.
6. The simulation will run, optimize parameters, and display the results graphically.

## Interpreting the Results

The simulation produces six graphs:

1. Total Resources Over Time
2. Happiness Over Time
3. Environmental Health Over Time
4. Social Cohesion Over Time
5. Population Over Time
6. Sustainability Practices Over Time

Each line in these graphs represents a different Resilience Hub. Analyze these graphs to understand how different factors interact and evolve over time in the simulated society.

## Customization

You can modify various parameters in the code to explore different scenarios:

- In `resilience_hub.py`:
- Adjust factors influencing resource production, consumption, and population growth
- Modify the impact and frequency of random events
- Change the weights of different factors in happiness calculation

- In `collaborative_stewardship.py`:
- Alter the resource regeneration rates
- Modify the knowledge transfer mechanism
- Adjust the inter-hub resource sharing algorithm

- In `simulation_runner.py`:
- Change the optimization parameters
- Modify the number of days simulated
- Adjust the plotting parameters

## Limitations and Considerations

- This is a simplified model and may not capture all real-world complexities
- The simulation assumes ideal conditions for cooperation and resource sharing
- Environmental factors are abstracted and may not reflect specific ecological processes

## Future Enhancements

- Implement more sophisticated environmental models
- Add geospatial factors to hub interactions
- Introduce more complex economic models
- Incorporate AI-driven decision making for hubs
